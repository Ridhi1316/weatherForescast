This is a weather forecast app

# The Problem
You need to build out a small application to fetch the weather forecast of multiple cities

# Step 1 : Get an API Key

Head over to OpenWeatherMap and register for an account
Once you are in, go to your personal page and get the API key

API KEY - in .env file

@ Example - https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?id=524901&appid={API key}
# Step 2

The app should accept multiple city names from the user
Based on the city names entered, the app should show the the weather forecast for the 14 days for each city

# Step 3

Find the current city using GPS
Display the weather forecast for the current city for 14 days

# Step 4
